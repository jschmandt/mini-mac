The task of this work is to create an authentication mechanism suitable for use on the CAN bus in automotive environments. Given the context, this mechanism must provide some measureable increase in security over the standard non-secured bus. It must not increase bus traffic and must not increase message delay characteristics.

In captured test data for a 2010 Toyota Prius, over 60\% of messages contain no more than four data bytes. This leaves 4 bytes of space for a MAC in the most common case. 

\textcolor{red}{Note: It's hard to list a requirement for performance or security here. I approached this work more with the idea of "how can I increase security at all, and how will it perform" rather than "here is how it must perform and the security it must have."}
