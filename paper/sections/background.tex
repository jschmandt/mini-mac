\section{Background}
\label{background}

This section briefly reviews essential background on vehicular security and message authentication codes. 
The experienced reader may wish to skip to Section~\ref{problem}. 
We assume the reader is familiar with cryptographic hash functions as explained, for example, 
by Stinson~\cite{Stinson} and NIST~\cite{FIPS-180-4}.

\subsection{ECUs}
\label{ecu}

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) found in an automotive computer network are low-power, single-purpose devices. ECUs on the CAN bus control many components in a modern automobile, from headlights and window controls, to brakes and engine. They are not typically designed with security in mind and frequently comprise a basic CAN bus transceiver, basic message processor, and an actuator. The message processor identifies whether or not a message being broadcast is interesting to the ECU and arbitrates bus rights with the other ECUs.

\subsection{The CAN Bus}
\label{can}

The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus 
is a simple, low-speed bus designed to network simple nodes. In an automotive environment, 
it typically runs at 500~kbps in automobiles~\cite{canbus}.\footnote{kilobits per second (kbps).}

Transmissions are organized in frames.  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-frame}, 
a frame contains an 11-bit identifier field and 
a data payload, as well as some control bits. Figure~\ref{fig-frame} shows the data payload as 8~bits, but
it can be 8 to 64~bits and is typically 64~bits.
The payload of up to 8~bytes is the most important element, 
as any MAC tag must fit into this frame or use a more complex multi-frame data transmission protocol 
that may or may not be supported on all ECUs. 
%typically 64 bits is based on observed data

We use the term ``message'' to refer to the data payload of one logical transmission.
Any payload longer than 64~bits must be sent as a multi-frame transmission.

Ideally, and in the case of Mini-MAC, the MAC tag
can fit into the payload together with the data, thus not increasing bus utilization. 
In test data captured by the authors from a 2010 Toyota Prius, 
approximately 61\% of messages contain at most four data bytes
(20\% contain 4~bytes; 16\% contain 3~bytes; 17\% contain 2~bytes; and 8\% contain 1~byte).
Approximately 35\% of messages contain a full 8~data bytes, and 4\% contain 7~bytes.
Thus, for most messages, there are at least four bytes of space available for a MAC tag.

Messages have fixed, known sizes.  The longest messages we observed were 
status reports describing the steering wheel angle and tire speed.

We observed approximately 25 messages sent per second on average (40 maximum per second).

\subsection{Bus Access}
\label{access}

To spoof or replay messages on the CAN bus, the attacker must have access to it.
There are several ways to access the CAN bus:  (1) There is a
physical connection through the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) port, 
typically located underneath the steering wheel.  An attacker might hide
access to this port by splicing into unexposed wires.
(2) An attacker might corrupt an ECU by rewriting its firmware. An attacker might
do so while the car is being serviced or by entering the car while it is parked.
(3) An attacker might gain access to the CAN bus by exploiting or corrupting a peripheral
device connected to it, such as a cellular phone, audio system, or Bluetooth
radio.  For example, Checkoway~\cite{Checkoway-2011} gained bus access by packing 
malware into a WMA audio file played on the car stereo. 
Rouf~\cite{Rouf2010} demonstrated information leakage and message spoofing on RFID-based tire pressure monitoring systems.

Despite many demonstrated security flaws, automotive 
manufacturers have been unreasonably hesitant to acknowledge the vulnerabilities inherent to the CAN bus,
sometimes wishfully claiming that undetected bus access is difficult. 
In 2013, Toyota~\cite{bbc_toyota} offered the following position on automotive security: 
``Toyota has developed very strict and effective firewall technology against such remote and wireless services.'' 
``We believe our systems are robust and secure.'' 
``The presence of a laptop or other device connected to the OBD [on board diagnostics] II port would be apparent.'' 
These statements demonstrate a failure to acknowledge the 
reality of wireless vulnerability of modern vehicles demonstrated in several notable publications.

\subsection{Message Authentication Codes}

Given a message and optionally a key, a Message Authentication Code (MAC) computes a short string (called a tag) 
that a recipient can use, together with the message, to verify the authenticity of the message.  
The recipient, who also knows the key, 
verifies the tag by recomputing it.

The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)~\cite{HMAC,FIPS-198-1} 
is a well-known MAC construction that keys an underlying component hash function.  
Breaking it is as hard as breaking the component hash function.

HMAC is computed as

\begin{equation}
H((k\oplus \text{opad})\concat H((k\oplus \text{ipad})\concat \text{message})) ,
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $k$ is the key, and opad and ipad are the outer and inner hash padding strings, respectively. 
These strings are constant strings defined by 0x5C and 0x36, repeated until the hash input is of the appropriate length. 
$H$ is the component hash function used. 
The symbols $\oplus$ and $\concat$ represent exclusive-or (XOR) and concatenation, respectively.
