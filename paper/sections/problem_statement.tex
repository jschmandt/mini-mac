\section{Problem Statement}
\label{problem}

Our task is to create an authentication mechanism suitable for use on the CAN bus in vehicular environments. 
The mechanism must improve security over the standard non-secured bus, while 
not increasing bus traffic nor delaying messages.
The mechanism must protect against replay and masquerade attacks as defined in Section 5.
It must function in the highly constrained vehicular environment,
which includes slow, low-power ECUs incapable of complex cryptographic functions.

%nd it must not violate message delay constraints. 
%nor unduely delaying important messages.
% can you quantify, or better hint at, message delay constraints?

In test data captured by the authors from a 2010 Toyota Prius, 
over 60\% of messages contain no more than four data bytes. 
Thus, for most messages, there are at least four bytes of space
available for a MAC tag.

% can you describe the distribution of available space more thoroughly?
% 35% percent of messages were the full 8 bytes. 4% were 7 bytes, 
% and the remaining 61% that are 4B or less are 20% 4 bytes, 16% 3 bytes, 17% 2 bytes and 8% 1 byte.
