\section{Problem Statement}
\label{problem}

Our task is to create an authentication mechanism suitable for use on the CAN bus in vehicular environments. 
The mechanism must improve security over the standard non-secured bus, while 
not increasing bus traffic nor delaying messages.
The mechanism must protect against replay and masquerade attacks as defined in Section 5.
It must function in the highly constrained vehicular environment,
which includes slow, low-power ECUs incapable of complex cryptographic functions.
